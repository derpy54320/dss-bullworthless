# TODO
This todo list contains things for Bullworthless *and* basync, since basync is primarily developed alongside Bullworthless so it can be tested in a real setting.

## Bullworthless
- Some sort of account system for saving. May make a simpler one than the existing one that just uses your DSL username but prompts you for a password.
- A tutorial notification when a player joins, telling them about the F2 menu.
- Better style controller script. You fight with the player style, but walk with your ped style.
- Switch model at clothing stores instead of using a menu. OR maybe make some sort of character system.
- Add some sort of inventory system for items.
- Add a money system.

## Basync
- Sync AI and give the server a lot of functions to control this behavior.
- Sync weapons but be sure to filter out crashy ones.
- Sync speech.
