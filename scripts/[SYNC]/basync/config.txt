# derpy's script server: basync - derpy54320

[REQUIREMENTS]
require_version 9
require_name basync

[FEATURES]
sync_world true			# "false" to not sync the world or "true" to sync things like weather and time
sync_entities full		# "off" to not sync, "full" to sync everything, or "partial" to only sync player peds and leave local entities alone

[OPTIONS]
alt_ped_stop_method true		# limit the population instead of using StopPedProduction (needed if you use a script that relies on PedFindRandomSpawnPosition)
allow_passengers true			# allow vehicle seats other than the driver seat to be used
control_passout true			# let basync control the player's passout behavior (disable if you have another script to control this)
force_player_ai true			# give the player ped player ai (disable this if you have another script that should control ai)

[TUNING]
slide_time_ms 150				# how many ms it takes for entities on the client to "slide" into their server position
ped_pool_target 21				# if there are over 20 peds when a ped is created (not including the new ped), a single ambient ped will be deleted instantly
ped_spawn_distance 55
ped_despawn_distance 65
vehicle_pool_target 10			# the normal limit is 15 but it is safer to stay under this
vehicle_spawn_distance 55
vehicle_despawn_distance 65
vehicle_physics_distance 30		# the range the vehicle should have physics (by changing its status), use -1 to disable this feature and never change status
