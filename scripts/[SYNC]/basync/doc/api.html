		<h1><a href="index.html">BASYNC</a> - Global API</h1>
		<h2>summary</h2>
		<p>
			Normally, you'd use the <a href="http://bullyscripting.net/dsl/globals.html#net">net table</a> to access <a href="functions.html">basync functions</a> and then use methods to interact with basync objects.
			This is still useful when you need more control over things, but it is often easier to use basync's <b>global api</b>.
			This api is a set of global functions made by basync that just make it more convenient to do things you can already do with normal basync functions, and make server scripting feel more like client scripting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind that even though the main point of these functions is to make server scripting more like client scripting, not everything will work exactly the same.
			There are some limitations, some changes, and some entirely new functions. So make sure to read the description for whatever function you're using.
		</p>
		<p>
			For an example of using the api, see these two approaches to spawning a ped on a server script. To most people, the 2nd approach is more intuitive.
		</p>
		<code>-- approach #1: using normal basync functions
ped = net.basync.create_ped(75)
ped:set_position(270, -110, 7)</code>
		<code>-- approach #2: using basync's global api
ped = PedCreateXYZ(75, 270, -110, 7)</code>
		<h2>client</h2>
		<p>
			These are all the global basync functions available on the client.
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr><th>PedFromNetworkId(id)</th><td>Returns a real ped given a network id.</td></tr>
			<tr><th>PedGetNetworkId(ped)</th><td>Returns a real ped's network id.</td></tr>

			<tr><th>VehicleGetNetworkId(vehicle)</th><td>Returns a real vehicle's network id.</td></tr>
		</table>
		<h2>server</h2>

			These are all the global basync functions available on the server.
